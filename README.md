In this project, we started by cleaning and converting Bike Data in New York and converting it into a new .csv file. 
We then used tableau's visualization tools to create maps, charts, and heat maps to discover trends or analyze the data. Tools like this can be very advantageous to any sort of business because of the angles you can view the data. Companies can make improvments by targeting certain locations or improve access when using the map tool in tableau. utilizing heatmaps can show busineses important or high traffic trends during the day or week from their customers and improve on that or make changes to fit those trends.
